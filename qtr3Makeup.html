								<h2>Week One</h2>

							</header>
								<p><b>Monday, January 6.  </b>We explored the four terrestrial planets.  Each student chose a planet and created a digital book about it.  Makeup:  Create a digital book about one of the four terrestrial planets.</p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, January 7.  </b>We completed our books and added a drawing of the solar system to our notebooks.  Makeup:  Add the drawing to your notebook.</p>
								<p><b>Wednesday, January 8.  </b>We completed a lab in which we modeled the expanding universe using a balloon.  Makeup: Get copies of the blank chart and graph, complete them, and glue them in your notebook.</p>
								<p><b>Thursday, January 9.  </b>We finished our work from Wednesday.</p>
						<header>
							<h2>Week Two</h2>
						</header>
								<p><b>Monday, January 13.  </b>We completed eight stations centered on Earth's layers.  Makeup:  Get the pages and complete them.</p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, January 14.  </b>We finished our work from Monday.</p>
								<p><b>Wednesday, January 15.  </b>We reviewed Earth's layers and drew them in our notebook.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes.</p>
								<p><b>Thursday, January 16.  </b>We completed a quiz on Earth's layers.  Makeup:  Get the quiz and take it.</p>
						<header>
							<h2>Week Three</h2>
						</header>
								<p><b>Monday, January 20.  </b>We graphed daylight hours of different latitudes, looking for patterns.</p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, January 21.  </b>We finished our graphs from yesterday.  We then modeled the phases of the moon using a lollipop and light.</p>
								<p><b>Wednesday, January 22.</b>We looked at what phase the moon would be in on our birthday this year.  Then we sketched it at three day intervals for 30 days.  Makeup:  Get the lab sheet and complete it.  The website is stardate.org/nightsky/moon.</p>
								<p><b>Thursday, January 23. </b>We finished the birthday moons lab.  Then we drew the moon phases in our science notebooks and took a short practice quiz on them.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes.  Make sure you understand the moon phases for the upcoming test.  </p>
						<header>
							<h2>Week Four</h2>
						</header>
								<p><b>Monday, January 27.</b>We did an experiment to explain what causes the seasons.  Makeup:  Copy the lab notes.</p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, January 28. </b>We reviewed our studies of day, night, and seasons.  Then we took a quiz.  Makeup:  Take the quiz. </p>
								<p><b>Wednesday, January 29. </b>We visited the Science Extravaganza at NNU.  No makeup.</p>
								<p><b>Thursday, January 30. </b>We did a lab wherein we "raced" three different liquids and made a graph showing their relative viscosities.  Makeup:  Complete the chart and graph.  (Check the class notes for an example.)</p>
						<header>
							<h2>Week Five</h2>
						</header>
								<p><b>Monday, February 3. </b>We charted the locations of 26 volcanoes on a map, looking for patterns. </p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, February 4.</b>We researched shield volcanoes.  Makeup:  Get the shield volcano page and write a paragraph that does the following:
									<ul>
										<li>Describe a shield volcano.</li>
										<li>Describe its lava.</li>
										<li>Explain how it erupts.</li>
										<li>Give the names of two actual shield volcanoes.</li>
									</ul></p>
								<p><b>Wednesday, February 5.</b>We researched composite cone and cinder cone volcanoes.  Makeup:  Same as you did for shield volcanoes on Tuesday.</p>
								<p><b>Thursday, February 6.</b>We completed our volcano research and made decisions about what kind of volcano we would each make.</p>
							<header>
								<h2>Week Six</h2>
							</header>
								<p><b>Monday, February 10. </b>We made a model volcano and mapped layers of lava in order to examine how volcanoes change surfaces in the solar system.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes. </p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, February 11. </b>We recorded notes about our lava layers.  Makeup: Copy the class notes.</p>
								<p><b>Wednesday, February 12. </b>We reviewed day, night, and Earth's rotation.  Makeup:  Complete the review packet.</p>
								<p><b>Thursday, February 13. </b>We worked on constructing volcanoes.</p>
							<header>
								<h2>Week Seven</h2>
							</header>
								<p><b>Monday, February 18. </b>President's Day--no school!</p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, February 19. </b>We differentiated between rocks and minerals.  Makeup:  Complete the notebook page.</p>
								<p><b>Wednesday, February 20. </b>We explored igneous rocks in a lab.  Makeup:  Complete the notebook page.</p>
								<p><b>Thursday, February 21. </b>We studied sedimentary and metamorphic rocks and had a notebook check.  Makeup:  Complete the notebook pages.</p>
							<header>
								<h2>Week Eight</h2>
							</header>
								<p><b>Monday, February 24. </b>We researched Lizard Butte and wrote a paragraph from the perspective of a travel guide.  Makeup:  Write a paragraph describing Lizard Butte.  What kind of volcano is it? What kind of lava is it made of? What effect did water have on it?</p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, February 25. </b>We discussed the rock cycle.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes.</p>
								<p><b>Wednesday, February 26. </b>We worked through as many erosion and weathering labs as we could.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes.</p>
								<p><b>Thursday, February 27. </b>We took a quiz on rocks and the rock cycle and completed an earth science review.  Makeup: 
									<ul>
										<li>Complete the quiz.</li>
										<li>Complete the review.</li>
									</ul></p>
