								<h2>Week One</h2>

							</header>
								<p><b>Monday, January 4.  </b>We explored three types of volcanoes.  Makeup:  Complete the circle book activity.</p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, January 5.  </b>We continued noticing the differences between Shild, Composite, and Cinder Cone volcanoes.</p>
								<p><b>Wednesday, January 6.  </b>We continued our work from Monday.</p>

						<header>
							<h2>Week Two</h2>
						</header>
								<p><b>Monday, January 11.  </b>We mapped patterns in volcano locations.</p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, January 12.  </b>We modeled three types of faultlines using graham crackers, cornstarch, and water.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes.</p>
								<p><b>Wednesday, January 13.  </b>We used a claim-evidence-reason model to answer why different types of lava are produced by volcanoes.</p>
								
								<p><b>Thursday, January 14.  </b>We worked on our volcanoes.</p>
						<header>
							<h2>Week Three</h2>
						</header>
								<p><b>Monday, January 18.  </b>We did a lab which simulated different viscosities of lava.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes.</p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, January 19.  </b>We completed math AimsWeb testing for the Middle School.</p>
								<p><b>Wednesday, January 20.</b>We completed AimsWeb testing for Language Arts for the Middle School.  Mrs. Patterson will contact you if you need to make this up.</p>
								<p><b>Thursday, January 21. </b>We did a lab in which we modeled the way scientists map lava layers.  See Mrs. Vawter for makeup.</p>
						<header>
							<h2>Week Four</h2>
						</header>
								<p><b>Monday, January 25.</b>We finished our Lava Layering Lab and worked on our volcanoes.</p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, January 26. </b>We finished our volcanoes and reviewed for a test.</p>
								<p><b>Wednesday, January 27. </b>We researched Igneous Rocks and recorded information.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes.</p>
								<p><b>Thursday, January 38. </b>We researched Sedimentary Rocks and recorded information.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes.</p>
						<header>
							<h2>Week Five</h2>
						</header>
								<p><b>Monday, February 3. </b>We charted the locations of 26 volcanoes on a map, looking for patterns. </p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, February 4.</b>We researched shield volcanoes.  Makeup:  Get the shield volcano page and write a paragraph that does the following:
									<ul>
										<li>Describe a shield volcano.</li>
										<li>Describe its lava.</li>
										<li>Explain how it erupts.</li>
										<li>Give the names of two actual shield volcanoes.</li>
									</ul></p>
								<p><b>Wednesday, February 5.</b>We researched composite cone and cinder cone volcanoes.  Makeup:  Same as you did for shield volcanoes on Tuesday.</p>
								<p><b>Thursday, February 6.</b>We completed our volcano research and made decisions about what kind of volcano we would each make.</p>
							<header>
								<h2>Week Six</h2>
							</header>
								<p><b>Monday, February 10. </b>We made a model volcano and mapped layers of lava in order to examine how volcanoes change surfaces in the solar system.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes. </p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, February 11. </b>We recorded notes about our lava layers.  Makeup: Copy the class notes.</p>
								<p><b>Wednesday, February 12. </b>We reviewed day, night, and Earth's rotation.  Makeup:  Complete the review packet.</p>
								<p><b>Thursday, February 13. </b>We worked on constructing volcanoes.</p>
							<header>
								<h2>Week Seven</h2>
							</header>
								<p><b>Monday, February 18. </b>President's Day--no school!</p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, February 19. </b>We differentiated between rocks and minerals.  Makeup:  Complete the notebook page.</p>
								<p><b>Wednesday, February 20. </b>We explored igneous rocks in a lab.  Makeup:  Complete the notebook page.</p>
								<p><b>Thursday, February 21. </b>We studied sedimentary and metamorphic rocks and had a notebook check.  Makeup:  Complete the notebook pages.</p>
							<header>
								<h2>Week Eight</h2>
							</header>
								<p><b>Monday, February 24. </b>We researched Lizard Butte and wrote a paragraph from the perspective of a travel guide.  Makeup:  Write a paragraph describing Lizard Butte.  What kind of volcano is it? What kind of lava is it made of? What effect did water have on it?</p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, February 25. </b>We discussed the rock cycle.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes.</p>
								<p><b>Wednesday, February 26. </b>We worked through as many erosion and weathering labs as we could.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes.</p>
								<p><b>Thursday, February 27. </b>We took a quiz on rocks and the rock cycle and completed an earth science review.  Makeup: 
									<ul>
										<li>Complete the quiz.</li>
										<li>Complete the review.</li>
									</ul></p>
						<header>
							<h2>Week Nine</h2>
						</header>		
								<p><b>Monday, March 2. </b>We reviewed the water cycle with Mr. Andy.  No makeup.</p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, March 3. </b>We completed a flipbook to remember the vocabulary associated with the water cycle.  Makeup:  Complete the two flipbook pages and put them in your notebook.</p>
