								<h2>Week One</h2>

							</header>
								<p><b>Monday, October 19. </b>We explored the special properties of water in the lab.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes.</p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, October 20. </b>We created a poster which explains the steps of the scientific method.</p>
								<p><b>Wednesday, October 21. </b>We became experts on different aspects of the scientific method and taught our classmates (jigsaw).  Makeup:  Copy the class notes.</p>
								<p><b>Thursday, October 22. </b>We finished our jigsaw activity from Wednesday.</p>

								<h2>Week Two</h2>
							</header>
							<p><b>Monday, October 28. </b>
								Students identified three types of variables:  independent, dependent, and controlled.  Makeup:  
								<ul>
									<li>Copy the class notes.</li>
									<li>Get the code to complete a Kahoot that reviews variables.</li></ul> </p>
							<p><b>Tuesday, October 29. </b>We used the scientific method to ask what happens when a sponge dries out. While waiting for results, we engineered card houses.  Makeup: <ul><li>Copy the class notes.</li>
								<li>If you have time, see how tall of a structure you can build out of a deck of cards.</li></ul></p>
							<p><b>Wednesday, October 30. </b>We made boats out of clay in order to try and understand how matter that is more dense than water can float.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes.</p>
							<p><b>Thursday, October 31. </b> We mixed sodium alginate and calcium chloride to make "gummy worms."  We were answering the question of what the difference is between synthetic and natural materials.  Makeup:
								<ul>
									<li>Copy the class notes.</li>
								</ul></p>
						<header><h2>Week Three</h2></header>
							<p><b>Monday, November 4. </b>  We began preparing to present information on a synthetic product.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Choose a synthetic product from the list (see Mrs. Vawter).</li>
									<li>Prepare a presentation that answers the three questions in the notes.  The presentation can be a video, slide show, advertisement, poster, document, or...?</li>
								</ul></p>
							<p><b>Tuesday, November 5. </b>We continued working on our presentations.</p>

						<p><b>Monday, November 11. </b>We put together periodic tables piece by piece, observing patterns as we went.</p>
						<p><b>Tuesday, November 12. </b>We put information about elements into rectangles, as seen on the periodic table.  We also made flashcards for next Thursday's quiz.  Makeup: 
							<ul>
								<li>Complete the Element Boxes page.</li>
								<li>Make flashcards from the Element Symbol Page.</li>
							</ul></p>
						<p><b>Wednesday, November 13. </b>We finished the work from Monday and Tuesday and played Element Bingo.</p>

						<p><b>Monday, November 18. </b>We completed a lab to explore how one might possibly figure out atomic mass, without being able to see atoms.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes.</p>   
						<p><b>Tuesday, November 19. </b>We practiced working with chemical formulas.  Makeup:  Get the "parrot" page and complete it. </p>
						<p><b>Wednesday, November 20. </b>We watched a clip and answered questions on edpuzzle in preparation for Thursday's element quiz. Makeup: Get the link and complete the questions on edpuzzle.</p> 
						<p><b>Thursday, November 21. </b>We took a quiz on 28 common elements.  Makeup:  Take the Elements Quiz.</p>

						<p><b>Monday, December 2. </b>We drew models of atoms with the correct numbers of protons, neutrons, and electrons.  Makeup: Get the lab sheet and copy the work from the class notes.</p> 
						<p><b>Tuesday, December 3. </b>We made models of molecules out of candy.  The candy really was icky, ask anyone.  Makeup: Get the lab sheet and copy it from the class notes.  We will not do numbers six through ten.</p> 
						<p><b>Wednesday, December 4. </b>We finished the questions from yesterday's lab and practiced categorizing elements, compounds, and mixtures.  Makeup:  Get some cards and practice categorizing.</p>
						<p><b>Thursday, December 5. </b>We looked at samples of matter and categorized them as elements, mixtures, or compounds.  Makeup:  Get the lab sheet and complete it.</p>
