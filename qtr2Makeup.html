								<p><b>Monday, October 21. </b>We explored the special properties of water in the lab.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes.</p>
								<p><b>Tuesday, October 22. </b>We created a poster which explains the steps of the scientific method.</p>
								<p><b>Wednesday, October 23. </b>We became experts on different aspects of the scientific method and taught our classmates (jigsaw).  Makeup:  Copy the class notes.</p>
								<p><b>Thursday, October 24. </b>We finished our jigsaw activity from Wednesday.</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Copy the class notes.</li>
									<li>Get the code to complete a Kahoot that reviews variables.</li></ul> </p>
							<p><b>Tuesday, October 29. </b>We used the scientific method to ask what happens when a sponge dries out. While waiting for results, we engineered card houses.  Makeup: <ul><li>Copy the class notes.</li>
								<li>If you have time, see how tall of a structure you can build out of a deck of cards.</li></ul></p>
