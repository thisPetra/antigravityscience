								<h2>Week One</h2>

							</header>
							<p><b>Wednesday, August 19.</b>  Students interviewed a classmate and put the information in a Frayer Model.  They measured a classmate's hand span using metric or U.S. Customary measurements.  During this process, students learned classroom procedures and rules.</p>
							<p><b>Thursday, August 20.</b>  Students watched a lab safety video, "Ultimate Lab Safety." The link to it is on the home page.  After discussion, the class created their own list of lab safety rules.  In groups or individually, students created something to explain lab safety rules.  They could create a story, a poster, or a video.</p>

					<header>
						<h2>Week Four</h2>
					</header>
							<p><b>Monday, September 7.</b>--Labor Day, no school.</p>
							<p><b>Tuesday, September 8.</b>We defined physical properties of matter and determined whether air was matter in a lab. Makeup: Copy the class notes.  
							<p><b>Wednesday, September 9.</b>We tested seven physical properties of three different samples of matter in the lab.  Makeup: <li>Get a lab sheet and glue it in your notebook.</li>
								<li>Copy the class notes.</li></p>
							<p><b>Thursday, September 10.</b>  We defined properties of metals.  Makeup:
								<li>Copy the class notes.</li>
								<li>Memorize the properties of metals.</li></p>
					<header>
						<h2>Week 5</h2>
					</header>
							<p><b>Monday, September 14.</b>  We compared physical and chemical changes of matter.  Makeup:
								<li>Get a lab sheet and glue it in your notebook.</li>
								<li>Copy the class notes.</li></p>
							<p><b>Tuesday, September 15.</b>We set up three test tubes and added chemicals.  We then explained which test tubes displayed a chemical reaction.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes. 
							<p><b>Wednesday, September 16.</b> We completed a study guide in preparation for a test.  Makeup:  Get the study guide and complete it.
							</p>
							<p><b>Thursday, September 17. </b>We took a test on physical changes and chemical changes.  Makeup:  Get the test and take it.</p>
					<header>
						<h2>Week 6</h2>
					</header>
							<p><b>Monday, September 21. </b>We reviewed three states of matter--solid, liquid, and gas, by making ice cream.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes.  The recipe is in the notes!  :)</p>
							<p><b>Tuesday, September 17.</b>We completed the reading portion of the fall AimsWeb testing.  No science today.</p><b>Wednesday, September 18.</b>  We completed the math portion of the fall AimsWeb testing.  Science again tomorrow!</p>
				<!--			<p><b>Thursday, September 19.</b>  We reviewed measurement, properties of matter, and density on Socrative.  Makeup:
									<li>Get a paper study guide from Mrs. Vawter and complete it.</li>
							</p>
						<header>
							<h2>Week Seven</h2>
						</header>
							<p><b>Monday, September 23.</b>  We computed the density of various objects in order to predict whether they would float.  We then checked our guess by putting the objects in a tank of water.
							Makeup:
								<li>Get the density page from Mrs. Vawter and complete it.</li>
								<li>Copy the class notes and attach the density page.</li>
							</p>
							<p><b>Tuesday, September 24.</b>  We finished what we started yesterday!</p>
							<p><b>Wednesday, September 25.</b>  We defined states of matter and phase changes while waiting for ice cream to freeze.  Makeup:
								<li>Copy the class notes.</li>
								<li>You might try making the ice cream at home...see the formula in the notes.  :)</li>
							</p>
							<p><b>Thursday, September 26.</b>  We reviewed properties of matter and density using music.  Makeup:
								<li>Complete the review sheet and tape it into your notebook.</li></p>
						<header><h2>Week Eight</h2></header>
							<p><b>Monday, September 30.</b>
								We began reviewing our properties of matter unit using a game format.  The game has eight stations that students must complete.  They are as follows: <ol>
									<li>A quiz on quizziz.</li>
									<li>A timed discussion about learning.</li>
									<li>A google survey about each student's learning.</li>
									<li>A video to create.</li>
									<li>A video to watch. Questions are included in the video.</li>
									<li>A selection to read and take notes on that discusses the history of the study of density.</li>
									<li>A sketch note to create about states of matter.</li>
									<li>A short video about density and floating to watch while taking notes.</li>
								</ol>
						</p>
