								<h2>Week One</h2>

							</header>
							<p>Wednesday, August 14.  Students interviewed a classmate and put the information in a Frayer Model.  They measured a classmate's hand span using metric or U.S. Customary measurements.  During this process, students learned classroom procedures and rules.</p>
							<p>Thursday, August 15.  Students watched a lab safety video, "Ultimate Lab Safety." The link to it is on the home page.  After discussion, the class created their own list of lab safety rules.  In groups or individually, students created something to explain lab safety rules.  They could create a story, a poster, or a video.</p>	

							<p>Monday, August 19.  Students created a presentation to explain lab safety rules.  Presentations could be in one of three forms: a written story, a poster, or a video.</p>

							<p>Tuesday, August 20.  We interviewed our classmates and took a measurement using either the metric system or the U.S. Customary system.  We discussed the differences.  In the process, we learned some class rules and lab procedures.</p>	

							<p>Wednesday, August 21.  After taking the science pretest, students reviewed metric length measurements and practiced using metric prefixes.</p>
