								<h2>Week One</h2>

							</header>
							<p>Wednesday, August 14.  Students interviewed a classmate and put the information in a Frayer Model.  They measured a classmate's hand span using metric or U.S. Customary measurements.  During this process, students learned classroom procedures and rules.</p>
							<p>Thursday, August 15.  Students watched a lab safety video, "Ultimate Lab Safety." The link to it is on the home page.  After discussion, the class created their own list of lab safety rules.  In groups or individually, students created something to explain lab safety rules.  They could create a story, a poster, or a video.</p>

							<p>Monday, August 19.  We created a presentation to explain lab safety rules.  Presentations could be in one of three forms: a written story, a poster, or a video.  Makeup:
								<li>Write a story or make a poster showing five rules of lab safety.</li></p>

							<p>Tuesday, August 20.  We took a science pretest and then practiced using our metric prefixes.  Makeup:
