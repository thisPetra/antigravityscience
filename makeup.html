								<h2>Week One</h2>

							</header>
							<p><b>Wednesday, August 14.</b>  Students interviewed a classmate and put the information in a Frayer Model.  They measured a classmate's hand span using metric or U.S. Customary measurements.  During this process, students learned classroom procedures and rules.</p>
							<p><b>Thursday, August 15.</b>  Students watched a lab safety video, "Ultimate Lab Safety." The link to it is on the home page.  After discussion, the class created their own list of lab safety rules.  In groups or individually, students created something to explain lab safety rules.  They could create a story, a poster, or a video.</p>	
						<header>							
							<h2>Week Two</h2>
						</header>
							<p><b>Monday, August 19.</b>  We created a presentation to explain lab safety rules.  Presentations could be in one of three forms: a written story, a poster, or a video.  Makeup:
								<li>Write a story or make a poster showing five rules of lab safety.</li></p>

							<p><b>Tuesday, August 20.</b>  We took a science pretest and then practiced using our metric prefixes.  Makeup:
								<li>Copy the class notes.</li>
								<li>Take the pretest.</li></p>	

							<p><b>Wednesday, August 21.</b>  We practiced measuring with millimeters and centimeters.  Makeup:
								<li>Complete the practice sheet and put it in your notebook.  See the class notes for a picture or check a classmate's notebook.</li>
									</p>
							<p><b>Thursday, August 22.</b>  We measured liquid volume.  Makeup:  
								<li>Copy the class notes.</li>
							</p>
					<header>
						<h2>Week Three</h2>
					</header>	
							<p><b>Monday, August 26.</b>  We measured the volume of regular and irregular solids.  We also practiced our metric prefixes and measuring with millimeters and centimeters.  Makeup:
								<li>Copy the class notes.</li>
								<li>Complete #1-5 on the practice sheet.</li>
								<li>Review your metric prefixes and the sentence we used to remember them.  These are in your notebook.</li></p>
							<p><b>Tuesday, August 27.</b>  We measured the mass of 10 objects using a triple beam balance.  Makeup:
								<li>Copy the class notes.</li>  </p>
							<p><b>Wednesday, August 28.</b>  Review.</p>
							<p><b>Thursday, August 29.</b>  Review.</p>
					<header>
						<h2>Week Four</h2>
					</header>
							<p><b>Monday, September 2.</b>--Labor Day, no school.</p>
							<p><b>Tuesday, September 3.</b>  We reviewed everything taught in the measurement unit using Socrative.  Makeup:
								<li>Complete paper unit review.</li></p>
							<p><b>Wednesday, September 4.</b>  We took a summative test on measurement.  Makeup:
								<li>Take the test.</li></p>
							<p><b>Thursday, September 5.</b>  We defined matter and listed examples and nonexamples.  We completed a lab using balloons to determine if air is matter.  Makeup:
								<li>Copy the class notes, including the table of contents.</li></p>
					<header>
						<h2>Week 5</h2>
					</header>
							<p><b>Monday, September 9.</b>  We defined physical properties of matter and did a lab to identify properties of three samples of matter.  Makeup:
								<li>Get a lab sheet and glue it in your notebook.</li>
								<li>Copy the class notes.</li></p>
							<p><b>Tuesday, September 10.</b>  We defined properties of metals.  Makeup:
								<li>Copy the class notes.</li>
								<li>Memorize the properties of metals.</li></p>
							<p><b>Wednesday, September 11.</b> We compared chemical changes and physical changes.  Makeup:
								<li>Copy the class notes.</li></p>
							<p><b>Thursday, September 12.</b> We completed a lab and identified chemical changes.  Makeup:
								<li>Copy the class notes.</li>
								<li>Be able to identify a chemical change.</li> </p>
					<header>
						<h2>Week 6</h2>
					</header>
							<p><b>Monday, September 16.</b>  We completed a KLEW chart and discussed how the mass and volume of a substance is related.  This is density.  Makeup:
								<li>Complete the chart and glue it in your notebook.  Make sure it's also in your table of contents!</li>
								<li>Copy the class notes.</li>></p>
							<p><b>Tuesday, September 17.</b>  We completed a density layer lab and took a properties of matter quiz.  Makeup:
								<li>Copy the class notes.  Put them in your table of contents.</li>
								<li>Take the quiz.</li> </p>
							<p><b>Wednesday, September 18.</b>  We measured a sample of water and figured its density.  Makeup:
								<li>Copy the class notes</li>
								<li>Make sure you know what the density of water is at room temperature!</li></p>
							<p><b>Thursday, September 19.</b>  We reviewed measurement, properties of matter, and density on Socrative.  Makeup:
									<li>Get a paper study guide from Mrs. Vawter and complete it.</li>
							</p>
						<header>
							<h2>Week Seven</h2>
						</header>
							<p><b>Monday, September 23.</b>  We computed the density of various objects in order to predict whether they would float.  We then checked our guess by putting the objects in a tank of water.
							Makeup:
								<li>Get the density page from Mrs. Vawter and complete it.</li>
								<li>Copy the class notes and attach the density page.</li>
							</p>
							<p><b>Tuesday, September 24.</b>  We finished what we started yesterday!</p>
							<p><b>Wednesday, September 25.</b>  We defined states of matter and phase changes while waiting for ice cream to freeze.  Makeup:
								<li>Copy the class notes.</li>
								<li>You might try making the ice cream at home...see the formula in the notes.  :)</li>
							</p>
							<p><b>Thursday, September 26.</b>  We reviewed properties of matter and density using music.  Makeup:
								<li>Complete the review sheet and tape it into your notebook.</li></p>
						<header>Week Eight</header>
							<p><b>Monday, September 30.</b>
								We began reviewing our properties of matter unit using a game format.  The game has eight stations that students must complete.  They are as follows: <ol>
									<li>A quiz on quizziz.</li>
									<li>A timed discussion about learning.</li>
									<li>A google survey about each student's learning.</li>
									<li>A video to create.</li>
									<li>A video to watch. Questions are included in the video.</li>
									<li>A selection to read and take notes on that discusses the history of the study of density.</li>
									<li>A sketch note to create about states of matter.</li>
									<li>A short video about density and floating to watch while taking notes.</li>
								</ol>
						</p>
						<p><b>Tuesday, October 1. </b>We are completing the eight stations from Monday.</p>
						<p><b>Wednesday, October 2.</b> We are completing the eight stations from Monday.</p>
