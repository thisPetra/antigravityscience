								<h2>Week One</h2>

							</header>
							<p><b>Wednesday, August 19.</b>  Students interviewed a classmate and put the information in a Frayer Model.  They measured a classmate's hand span using metric or U.S. Customary measurements.  During this process, students learned classroom procedures and rules.</p>
							<p><b>Thursday, August 20.</b>  Students watched a lab safety video, "Ultimate Lab Safety." The link to it is on the home page.  After discussion, the class created their own list of lab safety rules.  In groups or individually, students created something to explain lab safety rules.  They could create a story, a poster, or a video.</p>

						<h2>Week 6</h2>
					</header>
							<p><b>Monday, September 21. </b>We reviewed three states of matter--solid, liquid, and gas, by making ice cream.  Makeup:  Copy the class notes.  The recipe is in the notes!  :)</p>
							<p><b>Tuesday, September 22. </b>We completed the reading portion of the fall AimsWeb testing.  No science today. </p><b>Wednesday, September 23. </b>  We completed the math portion of the fall AimsWeb testing.  Science again tomorrow!</p>

							</p>
						<header>
							<h2>Week Seven</h2>
						</header>
							<p><b>Monday, September 28. </b>  We explored density with liquids.							Makeup:  Copy the class notes.
							<p><b>Tuesday, September 29. </b>We computed the density of various objects in order to predict whether they would float.  We then checked our guess by putting the objects in a tank of water.
							Makeup:
								<li>Copy the class notes.</li></p>
							<p><b>Wednesday, September 30. </b></p>
